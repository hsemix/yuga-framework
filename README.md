# yuga-framework
The Yuga Framework is a php framework that uses mvvm pattern at it's core and lets programmers reuse code even in their views (View-Models), it does this by mapping every html view to a php counterpart (code behind)
It has automatic validation and model binding to the view by default but that can change from the .env file

You can find it's documentation at https://yuga-framework.gitbook.io/documentation
